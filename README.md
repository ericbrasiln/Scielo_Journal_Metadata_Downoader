# Scielo_Journal_Metadata_Downoader
This Jupyter notebooks present some functions to download all the articles from a journal in the SCielo database, and use the XML JATS protocol to classify the articles.

There are three Jypiter notebooks on this repository so far. These notebooks should be executed in this specific order.  **Download Articles** will download all the articles of a specific scientific journal indexed in SCielo provided the link to that journal. **Article Metadata to DataFrame** will create a DataFrame object in Pandas and store a local csv file on your devise including the most relevant metadata of each article such as authors name, data of publication, keywords, abstract and so on. Finally, **Extract Article Text** will extract the article text to a txt format in a local folder. This could be very useful if you want to develop Natural Language Processing to the texts, of corpus linguistics. 

## Requirements
To execute these notebooks you required to have Python 3.X installed aswell as BeautifulSoup and Pandas.
